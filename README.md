# Sam's Sudoku Solver
### Simple in-browser Sudoku solver.

This is a Sudoku solver that I made in a few hours during a flight. I had never made a Sudoku solver before and it sounded fun. There aren't any particularly innovative techniques used, but it is quite efficient and drastically faster than a brute-force solving algorithm. I had a lot of fun making it.


Simply open *index.html* in a browser, modify/fill any inputs desired, and click solve.
