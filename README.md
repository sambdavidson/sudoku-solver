# Sam's Sudoku Solver
### Simple in-browser Sudoku solver.

This is a Sudoku solver that I made in a few hours during a flight. I had never made a Sudoku solver before and it sounded fun. There aren't any particularly innovative techniques used, but it is quite efficient and drastically faster than a brute-force solving algorithm. I does not really handle *unsolvable* presets and just tries it's best to solve. I had a lot of fun making it.

### How to use:

Fill in the 9x9 matrix with appropriate values then click solve.
